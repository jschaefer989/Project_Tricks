This will one day be my completed game, currently titled "Project Tricks"

To play it in its current state, you will need VS Code set up with Lua, Love2D and at least one extension capable of compiling and running games made in Love2D.

This project contains Typescript declaration files for the following Lua libraries:
* SUIT
* json.lua
* Lovely Toasts
* Push
* GameStateManager
* loaded_dice
