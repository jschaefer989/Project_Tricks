Based on Karnoffel, a German card game
Power comes from Karnoffel
Value loosely comes from Sheepshead


Bosses?
Enemies have more higher-level cards the further you progress - maybe separated by regions?

What happens when we cashout a negative value?

TODO:
Display enemy information on board
Adjust deck display on map

Enemies will be from Germanic folklore
Add bidding??
Add weapons??
Add special one-time use cards?? -> e.g. change the value of a card, or swap two cards, or change trump, or swap two cards for free
Add option to store stuff for the next run??

Ideas for other map events:
You find a hidden treasure chest with a random card
You can trade with a fellow traveler, card for a card
You get a quest from a local villager to beat a certain number of Enemies
You find an ancient statue that grants experience
