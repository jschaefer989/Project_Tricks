Based on Karnoffel, a German card game

Bosses?
Enemies have more higher-level cards the further you progress - maybe separated by regions?

What happens when we cashout a negative value?

TODO:
Display enemy information on board
Adjust deck display on map
Give unique IDs to all cards, since sometimes there will be duplicates

Add bidding??
