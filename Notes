Enemy hand is laid out
Player must pick cards that both beat the enemy's hand in power and score a lot of points
If the player's power is not greater than the enemy's power, no points are scored
Points scored are the players total - the enemy's total
Player is dealt X amount of cards at the start of a blind - that's all the cards they'll get
The player has to go through one or more rounds with the enemy, where the enemy plays some subset of their total cards per round
The player knows all of the enemy's cards, but doesn't know which ones they'll specifically play in a given round
Discarding can swap cards out in the player's hand with new ones in the deck

Bosses?
Enemies have more higher-level cards the further you progress - maybe separated by regions?

What happens when we cashout a negative value?
